# Introduction
With the development of the technology, many fields of the world have been changed and
upgraded. When comparing with Sri Lanka, though Sri Lanka have developed with some fields,
the bill reading system of water and electricity still have not changed. The system follows the
manual system yet. So, we decided to change the bill reading system from manual to
automatically. So, the main purpose of this system is to read the water bill and the current bill
by the user himself without any complex calculations. From this system the usage of current
and water can be reduced. As well as, from this smart meter system both user and the system
provider are updated with the current usage and the overall usage. From this system, it is
decided to perform both bill reading and bill paying system from only one system. So, this
software can be known as two in one software.
The system consists with both hardware part and a software part. The software part consists
with a web application and a desktop application. From the hardware part, the used units of the
device are calculated. The result which is given from the hardware part is taken from the
software part and from the software the output or the usage units and the bill is shown to the
user. So, both hardware part and the software part are interacted with each other well.
